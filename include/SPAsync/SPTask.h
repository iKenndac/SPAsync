    @abstract Convenience for asynchronously waiting on a task that returns a task.
    @discussion Equivalent to [task chain:^SPTask*(SPTask *task) { return task; } ...]
    @example sp_agentAsync returns a task. When run on a method that returns a task,
             you want to wait on the latter, rather than the former. Thus, you chain:
                [[[[foo sp_agentAsync] fetchSomething] chain] addCallback:^(id something) {}];
            ... to first convert `Task<Task<Thing>>` into `Task<Thing>` through chain,
            then into `Thing` through addCallback.
